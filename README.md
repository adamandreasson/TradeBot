# TradeBot

A stock trading simulator bot for Discord

## Setup

Requirements are Node.js and NPM. Start the bot with "npm run dev" command, which compiles the source code and launches build.

Copy config-template.json to config.json and fill in your details before launching.

A MySQL or MariaDB database is required. I've yet to add the schema to the repo but you might be able to figure it out until then.
